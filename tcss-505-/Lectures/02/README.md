Good morning, everyone. We will get started in a couple minutes, just
for a couple more people to show up.
Yeah.
Is that not what I called it?
just because something's running in user mode doesn't mean it can't still, mess be malicious.
Yeah, anyway, I think. That might be the end of today's lecture as a reminder.
yeah. Assignment. One is coming up. It's due like this week. Don't forget about the
surveys, the feedback surveys. They are worth something.
And I did. My last office hour on Thursday, I think.
yeah, I think I'm gonna make office hours on Thursdays from 7 to 8 Pm.
I made an announcement last time, but
that might be the set time. But
keep in mind. If you want to meet with me I can meet really, whenever so
just let me know if you need help. So yeah.
I think that's the end of today's lecture. So I'll stick around for a little bit here in the chat.
but otherwise that's the end.
but otherwise that's the end.
