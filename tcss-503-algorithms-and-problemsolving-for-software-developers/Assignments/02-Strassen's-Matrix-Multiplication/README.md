# Explanation of the `strassens` Method

The `strassens` method implements Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. This algorithm is more efficient than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices. It reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to approximately O(n^2.81). Here's a detailed explanation of how the method works:

## 1. Base Case

```python
if A.shape[0] == 1:
    return A * B
```

- **Purpose**: This is the base case for the recursion. If the matrices `A` and `B` are 1x1, the method simply returns the product of the two single elements.
- **Why**: This is the simplest case of matrix multiplication and serves as the stopping condition for the recursion.

## 2. Splitting the Matrices into Quadrants

```python
n = A.shape[0] // 2
A11 = A[:n, :n]
A12 = A[:n, n:]
A21 = A[n:, :n]
A22 = A[n:, n:]

B11 = B[:n, :n]
B12 = B[:n, n:]
B21 = B[n:, :n]
B22 = B[n:, n:]
```

- **Purpose**: The matrices `A` and `B` are split into four submatrices (quadrants) each: `A11`, `A12`, `A21`, `A22` and `B11`, `B12`, `B21`, `B22`.
- **Why**: Strassen's algorithm works by recursively applying the algorithm to these smaller submatrices.

## 3. Computing the 7 Products Recursively

```python
M1 = strassens(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)
M2 = strassens(A21 + A22, B11)
M3 = strassens(A11, B12 - B22)
M4 = strassens(A22, B21 - B11)
M5 = strassens(A11 + A12, B22)
M6 = strassens(A21 - A11, B11 + B12)
M7 = strassens(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)
```

- **Purpose**: Compute seven intermediate products (`M1` to `M7`) using the submatrices.
- **Why**: These products are used to construct the final result. Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of multiplications needed from 8 (in the naive approach) to 7, which is the key to its efficiency.

## 4. Computing the Values of the 4 Quadrants of the Final Matrix C

```python
C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
C12 = M3 + M5
C21 = M2 + M4
C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6
```

- **Purpose**: Calculate the four quadrants (`C11`, `C12`, `C21`, `C22`) of the resulting matrix `C` using the intermediate products.
- **Why**: These formulas are derived from the algebraic manipulation of the matrix multiplication process and are specific to Strassen's algorithm.

## 5. Combining the 4 Quadrants into a Single Matrix

```python
top = np.hstack((C11, C12))
bottom = np.hstack((C21, C22))

return np.vstack((top, bottom))
```

- **Purpose**: Combine the four quadrants into a single matrix by stacking them horizontally and vertically.
- **Why**: This step reconstructs the final product matrix `C` from its quadrants.

### Why the Method Works

Strassen's algorithm works by reducing the number of multiplications needed to compute the product of two matrices. The key insight is that matrix multiplication can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and by cleverly combining the results of these subproblems, we can achieve the same result with fewer multiplications.

- **Efficiency**: The reduction from 8 multiplications to 7 in each recursive step leads to a lower overall time complexity.
- **Recursion**: The algorithm recursively applies the same process to smaller submatrices, which allows it to handle large matrices efficiently.
- **Combination**: The final combination step ensures that the results of the subproblems are correctly assembled into the final product matrix.

By following these steps, Strassen's algorithm achieves a more efficient matrix multiplication process, especially for large matrices.
