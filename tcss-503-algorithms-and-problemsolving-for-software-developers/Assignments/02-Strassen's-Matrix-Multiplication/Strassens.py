## THE STUDENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT STRASSENS MATRIX MULTIPLICATION ALGORITHM
'''
The `strassens` function implements Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication, which is an efficient method for multiplying two 
matrices. The function takes two matrices, `A` and `B`, as input parameters and returns their product. Both matrices are converted to 
NumPy arrays to facilitate matrix operations.

The function begins by checking if the matrices are of size 1x1, which is the base case. If they are, it simply returns the product of 
the two single elements. For larger matrices, the function proceeds by dividing each matrix into four quadrants. This is done by 
calculating the midpoint `n` and slicing the matrices accordingly into `A11`, `A12`, `A21`, `A22` for matrix `A` and `B11`, `B12`, 
`B21`, `B22` for matrix `B`.

Next, the function recursively computes seven products (`M1` to `M7`) using combinations of these quadrants. These products are 
essential components of Strassen's algorithm and are calculated using specific combinations of matrix additions and subtractions.

After computing the seven products, the function calculates the four quadrants of the resulting matrix `C` (`C11`, `C12`, `C21`, `C22`) 
using these products. These quadrants are then combined into a single matrix by horizontally and vertically stacking them using NumPy's
`hstack` and `vstack` functions.

Finally, the function returns the combined matrix, which is the product of the input matrices `A` and `B`. This implementation of 
Strassen's algorithm reduces the time complexity of matrix multiplication from O(n^3) to approximately O(n^2.81), making it more 
efficient for large matrices.
