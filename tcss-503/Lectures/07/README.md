or series of problems. I should say we are going to start with a dynamic programming version of the Fibonacci
But the reason that backtracking is effective is because we're pruning the tree. Remember that that
a little tree structure that I used to represent the problem space and how we could say, Oh, well, we can't go red red. So we're gonna prune that branch and not explore it at all.
And then specific algorithms we covered were graph coloring. And then queens which I'm not going to go into.
That's last lecture before we dive into dynamic programming. Any go backs, call outs questions about backtracking.

I have one question about the
the assignment.
God do the miss every time? 9 by 9, divisible by 3? Or
is it the probability, is there a probability that the mess will not be divisible by 3.

And I might not be miss tracking the entire question. So the.

Yeah, I mean the port.
We have a port in the assignment, and if we divide by 3, is there a possibility?
There will be a reminder, or is it every time divisible by 3.

So what I'm going to be running tests on is A is a
you can see what's happening here. We're creating a bit of a binary tree.
Why, we can make this trade between
Right? This takes up more memory than the recursive algorithm, because the recursive algorithm isn't storing a huge array of all these solutions.
I'm just capturing the the amounts we can actually indicate whether or not we accepted that day
